# Project: Analysis of precipitation patterns (Mixteca, Mexico)

This project analyses the climatological characteristics of rainfall in La Mixteca Alta, Mexico, and its changes from 1981 to 2018. It uses data from CHIRPS (Rainfall Estimates from Rain Gauge and Satellite Observations). Aspects analyzed include the spatio-temporal distribution of mean annual rainfall, its seasonality, and variability. A report (in Spanish) can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/carlosdobler/Project_mixteca_precip_analysis/master/02_precip_analysis.html).
